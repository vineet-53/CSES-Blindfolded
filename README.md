# CSES Problem Set [Live Preview](https://cses-problem-set-vineet-53.vercel.app/)

# Purpose of this Website

- To make it helpful to not get hint of the category of problem.
- Which also makes the user to think about which correct data structure to use.

## I Built This Because...

- I love solving problems on CSES, but something bugged me. Knowing the problem category beforehand made it too easy. In real coding competitions, problems come out of nowhere, and you have to figure them out on the fly. This project fixes that!
- This tool helps you train for competitions by throwing CSES problems at you randomly, just like in a real contest. No more category spoilers, just pure problem-solving fun!
